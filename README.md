# Portfolio 2018
This is project that was created by me as part of the [Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001#). The intend of this website is to recreate a design mockup and build a portfolio website for current job applications and to show some of my work and skills.

## Usage
This project **must not** be used to complete challenges of the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree program. The challenges should be solved by yourself. However, this code may be used as a guidance but make sure not to copy over the source code.
